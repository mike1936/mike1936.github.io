        <h1>How to make a gpg-signing commit?</h1>
<p>26 Nov 2018 - Mike</p>
<h2 id="1-install-gnupg-generate-the-key-with-command">1. Install GnuPG, generate the key with command</h2>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gpg --gen-key</code></p>

<p>A GPG key generally contains following infomations (something not related with the commit signing process is obmited, such as comments):</p>

<p>1). <strong>Name</strong>;</p>

<p>2). <strong>Email</strong>;</p>

<p>3). <strong>Passphrase</strong> – !! KEEP IT SECRET !! , Passphrase is used for generating private key and verify your identity along with your private key, like a master-password of a database;</p>

<p>4). <strong>Public-key series</strong>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cipher text block</strong> – a plain text block, saves in a file with *.ASC extension, includes the most unabridged, complete information of the public key</li>
  <li><strong>Fingerprint</strong> – a string, “short version” of the cipher text block, used for identification</li>
  <li><strong>Key ID</strong> – a string, even “shorter version” of the fingerprint, mostly is the last 16bit of the fingerprint, for convenience, used in verification, like in this case</li>
</ul>

<p>5). <strong>Private-key series</strong>, !! KEEP IT SECRET !!,</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cipher text block</strong> !! KEEP IT SECRET !! one can easily derive the public-key cipher given the private one but not vise versa (because of the hardness to do prime factorization of a large number, which is the basis of RSA algorithm).</li>
  <li><strong>Passphrase</strong> !! KEEP IT SECRET !! as mentined before</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>It is possible to ‘recover’ the <strong>Public key Fingerprint</strong> and <strong>Key ID</strong> ‘from’ a <strong>Private Cipher text block</strong>, by importing the Private Cipher text block as a *.ASC file into a GPG license management tool such as ‘Kleopatra’, meaning that the <strong>Private Cipher text block</strong> ‘kind of’ contains all information of the whole GPG key.</p>

<h2 id="2-get-your-public-key-cipher-text-block">2. Get your Public-key Cipher text block</h2>
<p>Use command <code class="highlighter-rouge">gpg --list-keys</code> in terminal to take a snapshot of your public key infomation.</p>

<p>The output should contains a tab named ‘pub’ with a long CAPPED string, that is your <strong>Public-key fingerprint</strong>.</p>

<p>Then <code class="highlighter-rouge">gpg --armor --export [Public-key fingerprint]</code> should get you the <strong>Public-key Cipher text block</strong> for next step.</p>

<h2 id="3-github-website-setup">3. Github Website setup</h2>
<p>Go to https://github.com/settings/gpg/new, put your <strong>Public-key Cipher text block</strong> in and confirm.</p>

<h2 id="4-git-setup-in-terminal">4. git setup in terminal</h2>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Incase your GnuPG is not installed in a default folder, to makesure git can found the gpg executive, you need to set before use:</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="5-try-commit-and-it-should-work">5. Try commit and it should work</h2>
<p>You might need a third party GPG license management software such as ‘Kleopatra’ to enable the passphrase input pop-up prompt for each commit.</p>

<p>Or you can simply ommit the passphrase (not secure) during GPG key generation.</p>
