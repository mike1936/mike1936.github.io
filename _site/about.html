<p>Hello everyone! My name is Zixuan HE, Mike. I come from Shannxi province of China and have lived in Hong Kong for 7 years.</p>

<p>I love music, game and programming of course.</p>

<p>I used to be a good keyboard/piano player and beginner-level accordion player. But recently I fell in love with Ukulele and Hamronica. I was also a Tenor in a choir during my college.</p>

<p>I am full of enthusiasm about games. In the past year, I have quit my job and studied some game developing skills with myself, which includes game engine (Godot), pixel art and music compositionâ€¦ I hope someday I will be skilled enough to make my own game and become a indie developer.</p>

<p>My favorite programming language is Python. I learned it online myself. When I was in college, I have experienced C/CSS/HTML/Java/Javascript for my CS minor degree, R for statistic courses and Prolog for the AI course. In my first job, I have used VBA to build programs to help collect data from the server and generate metrics for business analysis, also writing documents for future maintenance.</p>

<p>I have finished my Bachelor degree in The Chinese University of Hong Kong majored in Risk Management Science minored in Computer Science. After graduation, I have go to the insurance industry - from back office to front office. But I found it only fulfilling my material needs. My recent plan is to go back to school, hopefully to the computer science department and enrich myself with systematic curriculums so that I will be able to get into the new industry. Wish me good luck!</p>
